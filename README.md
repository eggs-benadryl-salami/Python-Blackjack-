**Python Blackjack**

This is my first GitHub repository!

This is a simple Blackjack game built using Python. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.


ðŸ“‹ **Rules:** 
- Deposit the amount of money that you want to play with
- Enter the amount of money that you would like to bet on the game (from your deposit) 
- Enter the multiplier of the bet (1-5) 
- Cards are worth their face value; face cards are worth 10, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11.
- Choose to hit (draw a card) or stand (keep your current hand).
- The dealer will draw until they reach 17 or higher.
- You lose when your total goes over 21 or the dealer has a greater total
- You win when you have a greater total than the dealer or your total reaches 21
